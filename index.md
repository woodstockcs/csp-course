# Home

This is the CSP Class Docs. It is a website that houses all the documents and resources used by the AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) class at Woodstock Union High School Middle School (WUHSMS) for the 2024-2025 school year.

{: .warning}
This home page is based on our syllabus, which is still a _draft_. After a feedback cycle with students, the finalized syllabus will be linked here and this page will be updated where needed.

<!--

The sections below are based on [our class syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13gz4-Zm7xoDnXxb6Gx7-lF2RUrbFVSBX8860Ec7cW4M/preview), which was finalized on [date] after a feedback cycle with students.

# What we learn

### Coding: Python and Algorithms

- how to write and run python code
- functions and conditionals
- loops and lists

### Engineering: Efficiency and Software

- algorithms and runtime
- usability and testing
- publishing projects

### Data: Storage and Analysis

- binary and how computers use it
- spreadsheets
- privacy issues with data collection

### The Internet: Networking and Security

- how the internet works
- cybersecurity basics
- how to make and publish a website

# How we learn

### Classtime

Class meets every C Block. Attendance is important because your teacher and classmates learn from you. We use classtime to help each other build skills and work on projects.

### Homework

There is always more AP CSP to do. We make use of time outside of class to:

- prepare for group work
- check your understanding
- finish projects

# The AP Exam

The exam for AP Computer Science Principles is on May 15, 2025. You'll have 3 hours to answer 70 multiple choice questions and 2 short essay questions. The essay questions will be ask you to write about a coding project that you'll create _during classtime_ well before the exam. The College Board requires you send them that project by April 30, 2025.

# Grading

Your grade is based on these Anchor Standards: Citizenship, Testing and Refining, Creating Computational Artifacts.

|                                      | What it captures                                                                                                            | How it's scored                                                                                                                                        | How we handle late work                                                                                                                      |
| -----------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                      **Citizenship** | your ability to _communicate_ about technical things and the extent to which you use that ability to _support_ other people | _engagement credits_, which you accrue through shared notetaking, reflections on the impacts of computing, and code reviews                            | other students often depend on you to complete prep work before class (aka "homework"), so _late work does not earn engagement credits_      |
|             **Testing and Refining** | your ability to apply basic technical skills when _reading and fixing code_                                                 | _skill quizzes_, in which you are given a block of code to describe and change according to a specific standard without using notes or other resources | quizzes are offered on specific days in class, but our abilities improve over time, so _infinite retakes are available for a period of time_ |
| **Creating Computational Artifacts** | your ability to design and build _projects that are useful_ for other people                                                | _project specifications_, which are checklists you use to verify that your project contains all the required components                                | projects exist to help people and projects only get good after cycles of feedback, so _late revisions are accepted for a period of time_.    |


# Values and Agreements

If you're in this class, you're part of a community of people who spend a lot of time together. Each of us brings our personal values into the room, and for our room to function well we need to understand each others' personal values.

That understanding reveals some _shared values_, and those shared values drive our _agreements_. We all depend on you to stick to those agreements, which helps our classroom be a wonderful place to learn.

In Week 2 of school, this class identified the following values as important to us.
